### Packages

You probably only need to cite 

- **mcgv** for gam models
- **DHARMa** for model diagnostics
- **MASS** for negative binomial GLM models
- possibly the **tidyverse** for general data manipulation

but you should keep track of the packages used and their versions 
(see General Info, but note that if an workflow step was updated separately, see
the most up-to-date package versions under that pages "General Info").

**Note:** There are several papers for citing mgcv, but they recommend the 2017
book for an overview, which I think makes the most sense.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
cat("#### mgcv (for GAMs)\n")
c <- citation("mgcv") 
print(c[[4]], "text")

cat("\n#### DHARMa (for model checks)\n")
citation("DHARMa") |> print(style = "text")

cat("\n#### tidyverse (for general data management and figures)\n")
citation("tidyverse") |> print(style = "text")
```
